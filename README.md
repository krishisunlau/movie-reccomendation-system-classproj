Movie Recommendation System

This project demonstrates the development of a Movie Recommendation System leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and its enhanced variant, SVD++, for rating predictions and personalized recommendations. The project also incorporates fairness metrics to evaluate the equity and diversity of recommendations.

Project Features
Matrix Factorization Techniques: Utilized SVD and SVD++ to decompose the user-item matrix into latent factors for effective prediction of unseen ratings.
Fairness Evaluation: Implemented fairness metrics, including the Gini Index and Popularity Bias, to analyze concentration and biases in the recommendations.
Evaluation Metrics: Assessed system performance with metrics like Precision, Recall, F-measure, and NDCG to ensure accuracy and relevance of recommendations.
Reproducibility: Includes all code and data preprocessing steps for end-to-end reproducibility of the recommendation pipeline.
Academic Insights: Accompanied by a detailed research paper, which references relevant publications, outlines the methodology, and discusses results and future directions.
Technologies Used
Python
NumPy, pandas
